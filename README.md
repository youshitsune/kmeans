# kmeans
Implementation of K means algorithm in Rust. With animation using raylib.

## Installation
You need to have cargo already installed.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/youshitsune/kmeans
cd kmeans/
cargo run
```

## Usage
You can refresh the clusters by pressing **R** on your keyboard.

To start the animation you press **SPACE** to start and also to stop (stopping isn't built very well, so you would need to press **SPACE** several times).
